# Testbench

This folder contains testbench files for verification and testing of the MIPS32 RISC processor.

There are test benches for few important submodules with name_tb.v format

Then there are updated instruction memory and data memory (where needed) with instruction preloaded. 

There are separate testbenches customised for different category of instructions as apparent in their file name.
